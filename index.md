The Hacker Within, began as a student organization at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison, and is now reborn as a collection of such chapters around
the world.

Each of the chapters convenes a community of scientists, at all levels of
their education and training, to share their knowledge and best practices in
using computing to accomplish their work.
